# Quiz

A simple webapp ongoing development.

## Installing

To install and run this app, do this:

### Clone the repo first

git clone https://github.com/Youngestdev/quiz.git 

```

### Navigate into the folder and install dependencies

Run the command below to do so,

```

### Run App

App would be installed fully in a minute, then run app and navigate to `localhost:8000' . Run app with the command:

npm run start
```

### Setting up MONGODB details

I believe you have `mongodb` installed if not, visit [here for installation details]()

Setup your mongodb database connection details by first, creating a folder where mongodb will store it's files and create an instance of mongo :

```sh
$> mkdir database & mongod --dbpath database
```

And, we're ready to run your app fully.
